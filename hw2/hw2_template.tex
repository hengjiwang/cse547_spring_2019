\end{center}

\textbf{Assignment Submission } All students should submit their assignments electronically via GradeScope. Students may typeset or scan their \textbf{neatly written} homeworks (points \textbf{will} be deducted for illegible submissions). Simply sign up on the Gradescope website and use the course code 97EWEW. Please use your UW NetID if possible.
\\
\\
For the non-coding component of the homework, you should upload a PDF rather than submitting as images. We will use Gradescope for the submission of code as well. Please make sure to tag each part correctly on Gradescope so it is easier for us to grade. There will be a small point deduction for each mistagged page and for each question that includes code. Put all the code for a single question into a single file and upload it. Only files in text format (e.g. .txt, .py, .java) will be accepted. \textbf{There will be no credit for coding questions without submitted code on Gradescope, or for submitting it after the deadline}, so please remember to submit your code.
\\
\\
\textbf{Late Day Policy } All students will be given two no-questions-asked late periods, but only one late period can be used per homework and cannot be used for project deliverables. A late-period lasts 48 hours from the original deadline (so if an assignment is due on Thursday at 11:59 pm, the late period goes to the Saturday at 11:59pm Pacific Time).
\\
\\
\textbf{Academic Integrity} We take academic integrity extremely seriously:\\ (\url{https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/misconduct}).\\
We strongly encourage students to form study groups. Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups. However, each student must write down the solutions and the code independently. In addition, each student should write down the set of people whom they interacted with.
